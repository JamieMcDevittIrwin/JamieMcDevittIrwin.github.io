I am committed to learning and growing as an instructor and have taken various courses on course development and how to be an inclusive and effective teacher to diverse students (e.g. [Inclusive and Effective Teaching](https://vpge.stanford.edu/resources/sgsi-2022-inclusive-and-effective-teaching), [Science and Engineering Course Design](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=CTL%20312:%20Science%20and%20Engineering%20Course%20Design&academicYear=20202021)). In addition, I shadowed a professor at West Valley Community College through the [Preparing Future Professors](https://vpge.stanford.edu/events/programs/preparing-future-professors) program.
