I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Marine Science Institute](https://msi.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara working with [Dr. Deron Burkepile](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/). I am a marine ecologist who seeks to understand how ecological communities are structured and how humans are altering these communities during this time of global change and biodiversity loss. I ask fundamental ecological questions in community ecology that can then inform conservation and management. I recently finished my PhD at Stanford University working with [Dr. Fiorenza Micheli](https://michelilab.stanford.edu/) at the [Hopkins Marine Station](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/).
