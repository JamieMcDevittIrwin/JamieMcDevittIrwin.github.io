*I will join the [University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/lifesciences/) as an Assistant Professor starting August 2025. If you are interested in joining my lab, please find information [here](join.html)!*  

I am a marine ecologist who seeks to understand how ecological communities are structured and how humans are altering these communities during this time of global change and biodiversity loss. I ask fundamental questions in community ecology that can then inform conservation and management. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Marine Science Institute](https://msi.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara working with [Dr. Deron Burkepile](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/).
