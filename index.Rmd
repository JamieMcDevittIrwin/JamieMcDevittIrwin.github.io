I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Marine Science Institute](https://msi.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara working with [Dr. Deron Burkepile](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/). **My research determines how human impacts are altering marine coastal ecosystems.** I evaluate how biodiversity, community structure, and resilience are altered under anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction. I combine theory driven experiments, observational fieldwork, and quantitative syntheses primarily working in marine coastal ecosystems but am interested in comparing patterns across ecosystems and taxa to search for general theory. I recently finished my PhD at Stanford University working with [Dr. Fiorenza Micheli](https://michelilab.stanford.edu/) at the [Hopkins Marine Station](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/).
