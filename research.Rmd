My research interests fit within three broad themes that often overlap and interact:  

### I) Trophic interactions structuring communities            
I'm interested in how consumers (e.g., predators, herbivores) influence how communities look and function. I have assessed how large fishes affect coral reefs through field experiments and data-syntheses. In this work, I evaluated how large fishes structure coral recruitment, community variability and turnover, and if there are cascading trophic interactions down from large predators to coral reef recovery. In addition, I evaluated how the arrival timing of consumers influences recovery trajectories by conducting a field experiment in the rocky intertidal.

### II) Biodiversity patterns and consequences of biodiversity change    
In addition, I'm interested in how biodiversity patterns vary through space and time and what are the consequences of biodiversity change. I've previously evaluated congruence in coral reef diversity patterns (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2021), the influence of wave exposure on coral reef recovery dynamics (Lange et al. 2021), and how fishing and habitat influence herbivorous fish grazing (Robinson et al. 2019).

### III) Global and local stressors altering communities       
My research also focuses on how global and local stressors are currently altering communities around the world. I've typically approached this research on coral reef ecosystems, at both the micro and macro scale. I've evaluated how both local human disturbances and El Nino events influence the coral microbiome (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2018, McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2019, Claar et al. 2020) and how heat stress events influence coral reef resilience and bleaching patterns (Claar et al. 2018, Baum et al. 2023).
