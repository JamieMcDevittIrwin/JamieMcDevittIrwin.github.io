Anthropogenic stressors are dramatically altering our world and causing intense biodiversity loss known as the sixth mass extinction event. During this time of global change, its critical to understand how anthropogenic stressors are altering ecological communities and biodiversity. 

### I) Trophic interactions structuring communities and ecosystems             
As these consumers are critical drivers of community structure and ecosystem function, its crucial to evaluate the cascading effects of when consumers are lost from ecosystems due to anthropogenic pressures. I have done extensive research on how the loss of large fishes influences coral reef recovery after disturbances, primarily through field experiments in remote locations. We have demonstrated that the positive and negative effects of fishes vary through time (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2023) and excluding large fishes lead to more variable and unpredictable benthic communities across space and time (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2023). Furthermore, we have shown that large MPAs not only promote herbivorous fish populations that control algae during reef recovery but also strengthen reef resilience to cascading trophic interactions (McDevitt-Irwin et al. Submitted). Finally, we have shown that the arrival timing of herbivores affects the short-term but not long-term recovery dynamics of algae communities in the rocky intertidal (McDevitt-Irwin et al. In Prep).

### II) Causes and consequences of biodiversity change   
As our world is facing intense biodiversity loss, I’m interested in the drivers of biodiversity patterns across space and time and the ecosystem wide consequences of biodiversity change across multiple levels of biological organization. My current post-doctoral work evaluates how coral reef biodiversity - from fishes, corals, algae, invertebrates to the coral microbiome - is driven by anthropogenic stressors such as the loss of herbivorous fishes, nutrient pollution, and marine heat waves. Previously, I've shown that local human disturbances and El Niño events can increase diversity and destabilize the coral microbiome (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2018, McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2019, Claar et al. 2020) and that reef benthic taxa have congruence in their landscape biodiversity patterns (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2021).
