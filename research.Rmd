My research interests fit within three broad themes that often overlap and interact:  

### I) Trophic interactions structuring communities and ecosystems             
I’m interested in how consumers (e.g., predators, herbivores) influence how communities look and function. I typically address this objective by using a combination of field experiments, observational surveys, and data-syntheses. I have evaluated how large fishes influence coral recruitment (McDevitt-Irwin et al. In Review), benthic community variability and turnover (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2023), and if there are cascading trophic interactions down from sharks to coral reef recovery (McDevitt-Irwin et al. In Review). In addition, I am currently evaluating how the arrival timing of consumers influences recovery trajectories in the rocky intertidal.

### II) Causes and consequences of biodiversity change   
In addition, I’m interested in drivers of biodiversity patterns, how these patterns vary through space and time, and the ecosystem wide consequences of biodiversity change. My current work will address these questions using innovative technologies such as eDNA, bioacoustics, and computer vision. Previously, I've tackled these questions using traditional observational surveys and 16S Illumina sequencing. I’ve evaluated how local human disturbances and El Niño events influence coral microbiome diversity (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2018, McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2019, Claar et al. 2020) and how coral reef benthic taxa have congruence in their diversity patterns (McDevitt-Irwin et al. 2021).

### III) Ecosystem resilience to global change         
My research also evaluates how ecosystems are affected by escalating global stressors such as rising temperatures and increased heat waves. In particular, I'm interested in what makes an ecosystem resilient to these stressors. Using observational surveys and data-syntheses, I've evaluated how El Niño events influence coral reef bleaching patterns (Claar et al. 2018), how local anthropogenic stress interacts with heat stress events to affect coral reef resilience (Baum et al. 2023), and how abiotic drivers influence coral reef recovery from bleaching events (Lange et al. 2021).
